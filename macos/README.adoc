= Eurostep EXPRESS Parser (EEP) - macOS binaries

== Purpose

This directory contains macOS binaries for the Eurostep EXPRESS Parser (EEP)
version V1.4.45 from 2022.

== Available binaries

Two binaries are provided for different macOS versions:

`eep_macos_10-11`:: Intel x86_64 executable for macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) and later
`eep_macos_12`:: Intel x86_64 executable for macOS 12 (Monterey) and later

NOTE: Both binaries are Intel (x86_64) executables. The difference is the
minimum macOS version required. Use `eep_macos_10-11` for compatibility with
older macOS versions, and `eep_macos_12` for systems running macOS 12 and
later.
