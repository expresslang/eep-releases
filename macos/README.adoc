= Eurostep EXPRESS Parser (EEP) - macOS binaries

== Purpose

This directory contains macOS binaries for the Eurostep EXPRESS Parser (EEP)
version 1.4.45.

== Available binaries

Two binaries are provided for different macOS versions:

`eep-macos-10.11-x64`:: Intel x86_64 executable for macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) and later
`eep-macos-12-x64`:: Intel x86_64 executable for macOS 12 (Monterey) and later

NOTE: Both binaries are Intel (x86_64) executables. The difference is the
minimum macOS version required. Use `eep-macos-10.11-x64` for compatibility with
older macOS versions, and `eep-macos-12-x64` for systems running macOS 12 and
later.

== Installation

=== macOS 10.11 and later (older systems)

[source,bash]
----
# Make executable
chmod +x eep-macos-10.11-x64

# Install to system path
sudo mv eep-macos-10.11-x64 /usr/local/bin/eep

# Verify installation
eep --help
----

=== macOS 12 and later (newer systems)

[source,bash]
----
# Make executable
chmod +x eep-macos-12-x64

# Install to system path
sudo mv eep-macos-12-x64 /usr/local/bin/eep

# Verify installation
eep --help
----

NOTE: On modern macOS versions, you may need to remove the quarantine
attribute after downloading:

[source,bash]
----
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine eep-macos-10.11-x64
# or
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine eep-macos-12-x64
----

== System requirements

* Mac OSX 10.4.8 or later (Experimental development)
* Intel x86_64 processor
* For `eep-macos-10.11-x64`: macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) minimum
* For `eep-macos-12-x64`: macOS 12 (Monterey) minimum

== Which binary should I use?

* If you have macOS 10.11 through 11.x: Use `eep-macos-10.11-x64`
* If you have macOS 12 or later: Either binary will work, but `eep-macos-12-x64`
  is recommended for newer systems

== Notes

macOS support was marked as "experimental" in the original release. While the
binaries function, some features may have limitations on macOS platforms.

Both binaries are Intel-only executables. For Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3),
these binaries will run under Rosetta 2 translation.
