= Eurostep EXPRESS Parser (Eep) releases
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== Purpose

This repository provides the legacy releases of the Eurostep EXPRESS Parser
("Eep"), a command-line tool for working with EXPRESS schemas.

Eep enables EXPRESS models to be verified against either the published EXPRESS
language (ISO 10303-11:2004) or the first edition (ISO 10303-11:1994).

It can generate a "pretty printed" form of the verified EXPRESS, concatenation
of EXPRESS schemas, and conversion of EXPRESS schemas to the ISO 10303-28 form
of EXPRESS XML for use with XML-based tools.

These binaries are archived versions of Eep that were originally distributed by
Eurostep.

The original download page has been archived at:

https://web.archive.org/web/20120119142727/http://www.eurostep.com/global/solutions/download-software.aspx

This repository serves to preserve and provide continued access to these tools
for the EXPRESS language community.

== Installation

=== System requirements

Minimum requirements as specified by Eurostep:

* Windows 2000/XP/Vista, Windows Server 2003/2008
* Linux with libc version 6
* Mac OSX 10.4.8 or later (Experimental development)

NOTE: These binaries are from 2008 and may require compatibility layers on
modern operating systems. Testing on current systems is recommended.

WARNING: The executable on Windows is called `Eep.exe` (capitalized), while on
Linux and macOS it is called `eep` (all lowercase).

=== Linux

==== x86-64 systems

On x86-64 Linux systems, use the following commands to download and install:

[source,bash]
----
# Download the binary
wget https://github.com/expresslang/eep-releases/raw/main/linux/eep-linux-x64

# Make executable and install
chmod +x eep-linux-x64
sudo mv eep-linux-x64 /usr/local/bin/eep

# Verify installation
eep --help
----

==== ARM64 systems

The `eep-linux-x64` binary is compiled for x86-64 architecture but can run on
ARM64 (aarch64) Linux systems through **QEMU user-mode emulation**.

QEMU provides transparent binary translation, allowing x86-64 binaries to
execute on ARM64 systems with minimal setup:

[source,bash]
----
# Install QEMU user-mode emulation and multi-architecture support
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y qemu-user-static binfmt-support

# Enable x86-64 architecture and install runtime libraries
sudo dpkg --add-architecture amd64
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libc6:amd64

# Download and use the binary
wget https://github.com/expresslang/eep-releases/raw/main/linux/eep-linux-x64
chmod +x eep-linux-x64
./eep-linux-x64 --help
----

For detailed ARM64 compatibility instructions, including Docker setup and
troubleshooting, see link:linux/README.adoc[linux/README.adoc].

NOTE: QEMU emulation provides good compatibility with some performance overhead.
The emulation is transparent and requires no code changes.


=== macOS

The repository provides two versions for different macOS releases:

==== macOS 10.11 and compatible systems

This binary is compatible with Intel-based Macs (`x86_64`) running macOS 10.11
and later.

[source,bash]
----
# Download the binary
curl -L -o eep https://github.com/expresslang/eep-releases/raw/main/macos/eep-macos-10.11-x64

# Make executable and install
chmod +x eep
sudo mv eep /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
eep --help
----

Architecture of binary:

[source,bash]
----
$ file ./macos/eep-macos-10.11-x64
./macos/eep-macos-10.11-x64: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
----

==== macOS 12 and later

This binary is compatible with Intel-based Macs (`x86_64`) running macOS 12 and
later.

[source,bash]
----
# Download the binary
curl -L -o eep https://github.com/expresslang/eep-releases/raw/main/macos/eep-macos-12-x64

# Make executable and install
chmod +x eep
sudo mv eep /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
eep --help
----

Architecture of binary:

[source,bash]
----
$ file ./macos/eep-macos-12-x64
./macos/eep-macos-12-x64: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
----

=== Windows

[source,powershell]
----
# Download Eep.exe from the repository
# Place it in a directory included in your system PATH

# Verify installation
Eep.exe --help
----

Or download directly from:
https://github.com/expresslang/eep-releases/raw/main/windows/eep-windows-x86.exe

NOTE: You may rename the downloaded file to `Eep.exe` if you prefer the traditional Windows naming convention.

Add the directory containing `Eep.exe` to your system PATH manually through
System Properties > Environment Variables.


[[express-parsing]]
== EXPRESS parsing and validation

=== General

Eep validates EXPRESS models against the ISO 10303-11 standard, which defines
the EXPRESS language used in STEP application protocols and other industrial
data modeling applications.

The parser can verify models against two editions of the standard:

* ISO 10303-11:2004 (second edition) - the current standard
* ISO 10303-11:1994 (first edition) - for legacy compatibility

This dual-standard support ensures that both modern and historical EXPRESS
schemas can be processed and validated correctly.

=== Validation capabilities

Eep performs comprehensive validation including:

* Syntax checking against EXPRESS grammar
* Semantic analysis of entity definitions
* Constraint verification
* Reference validation
* Type compatibility checking

Any errors or warnings are reported with file locations and detailed
descriptions to assist in correcting the schema.


[[usage]]
== Use cases

=== General


=== EXPRESS schema concatenation

=== XML standard form (ISO 10303-28)


.Generating XML output
====
[source,bash]
----
# Generate XML representation
eep -x schema.exp > schema.xml
----
====

The XML format follows the EXPRESS XML schema standard, ensuring compatibility
with other tools in the EXPRESS ecosystem.


[[legacy-preservation]]
== Legacy preservation

=== General

This repository preserves the most recent public release of Eep V1.4.45 as
provided to ISO/TC 184/SC 4 from 2022.

The last public release archived by the Internet Archive is Eep V1.3.34 from
October 24, 2008.

While the tool is no longer actively developed, it remains valuable for:

* Processing legacy EXPRESS schemas
* Supporting older STEP application protocols
* Maintaining compatibility with historical data
* Educational and research purposes

=== Historical context

Eep was developed by Eurostep, a company specializing in PLM (Product Lifecycle
Management) and STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product model data)
technologies. The tool was freely distributed as freeware to support the
EXPRESS and STEP communities.

While Eurostep's website has changed due to its acquisition by BAE Systems, the
archived version at the Wayback Machine preserves this historical information.
