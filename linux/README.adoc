= Eurostep EXPRESS Parser (EEP) - Linux binaries

== Purpose

This directory contains the Linux binary for the Eurostep EXPRESS Parser (EEP)
version 1.4.45.

== Available binaries

`eep-linux-x64`:: Linux executable for x86-64 systems

== Installation

[source,bash]
----
# Make executable
chmod +x eep-linux-x64

# Install to system path
sudo mv eep-linux-x64 /usr/local/bin/eep

# Verify installation
eep --help
----

=== Alternative installation locations

You can install to different locations based on your preference:

[source,bash]
----
# System-wide installation (requires sudo)
sudo mv eep-linux-x64 /usr/local/bin/eep

# User-specific installation (no sudo required)
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv eep-linux-x64 ~/.local/bin/eep
# Ensure ~/.local/bin is in your PATH

# Custom directory installation
mkdir -p ~/bin
mv eep-linux-x64 ~/bin/eep
# Add ~/bin to your PATH in ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
----

== System requirements

* Linux with glibc version 6 or later
* x86-64 architecture
* Most modern Linux distributions meet these requirements

== Compatibility

The EEP binary has been tested and works on:

* Ubuntu/Debian-based distributions
* RHEL/CentOS/Fedora-based distributions
* Other modern Linux distributions with glibc 6+

== Troubleshooting

=== Missing libraries

If you encounter missing library errors:

[source,bash]
----
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libc6

# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
sudo yum install glibc
# or
sudo dnf install glibc
----

=== Permission denied

If you receive permission errors:

[source,bash]
----
# Make the binary executable
chmod +x eep-linux-x64

# Verify it's executable
ls -la eep-linux-x64
----

=== ARM64 Linux compatibility

The `eep-linux-x64` binary is compiled for x86-64 architecture. However, it can
run on ARM64 (aarch64) Linux systems through QEMU user-mode emulation, which
provides transparent binary translation.

==== Overview

Running x86-64 binaries on ARM64 Linux requires:

1. **QEMU user-mode emulation** - Enables transparent execution of x86-64 binaries
2. **Multi-architecture support** - Allows installation of x86-64 libraries alongside ARM64
3. **x86-64 runtime libraries** - Required dependencies for the binary

==== Ubuntu/Debian ARM64 systems

On Ubuntu or Debian ARM64 systems, follow these steps:

[source,bash]
----
# 1. Install QEMU user-mode emulation
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y qemu-user-static binfmt-support

# 2. Enable multi-architecture support
sudo dpkg --add-architecture amd64

# 3. Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# 4. Install x86-64 runtime libraries
sudo apt-get install -y libc6:amd64

# 5. Make the binary executable
chmod +x eep-linux-x64

# 6. Test the binary
./eep-linux-x64 --help
----

Once configured, the binary will run transparently through QEMU emulation.

==== Docker containers on ARM64

For Docker containers running on ARM64 hosts (including Apple Silicon Macs),
use the same approach:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM ubuntu:24.04

# Install QEMU and multi-arch support
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y qemu-user-static binfmt-support && \
    dpkg --add-architecture amd64 && \
    apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y libc6:amd64

# Copy and use the binary
COPY eep-linux-x64 /usr/local/bin/eep
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/eep
----

Or in a running container:

[source,bash]
----
# Inside an ARM64 container
apt-get update
apt-get install -y qemu-user-static binfmt-support
dpkg --add-architecture amd64
apt-get update
apt-get install -y libc6:amd64

# Now the x86-64 binary will work
./eep-linux-x64 --help
----

==== Performance considerations

* **QEMU emulation** provides good compatibility but with some performance overhead
* For production use on ARM64, consider using a native ARM64 binary if available
* The emulation is transparent - no code changes needed
* Performance is typically sufficient for command-line tools like EEP

==== Verification

To verify the setup is working:

[source,bash]
----
# Check QEMU is installed
which qemu-x86_64-static

# Check binfmt support
ls -la /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/

# Verify the binary architecture
file eep-linux-x64
# Should show: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64

# Test execution
./eep-linux-x64 --help
# Should display help without errors
----

=== 32-bit compatibility

On 64-bit systems, if you encounter architecture-related errors, you may need
32-bit compatibility libraries:

[source,bash]
----
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libc6:i386

# RHEL/CentOS
sudo yum install glibc.i686
----
